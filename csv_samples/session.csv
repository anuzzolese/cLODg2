In recent years, this collective intelligence has spread to many different areas, with particular focus on fields related to everyday life such as commerce, tourism, education, and health, causing the size of the social Web to expand exponentially.
To identify the emotions (e.g. sentiment polarity, sadness, happiness, anger, irony, sarcasm, etc.) and the modality (e.g. doubt, certainty, obligation, liability, desire, etc.) expressed in this continuously growing content is critical to enable the correct interpretation of the opinions expressed or reported about social events, political movements, company strategies, marketing campaigns, product preferences, etc.

This has raised growing interest both within the scientific community, by providing it with new research challenges, as well as in the business world, as applications such as marketing and financial prediction would gain remarkable benefits.

This workshop proposal is a follow-up of ESWC 2014 workshop on ``Semantic Web and Sentiment Analysis''.

Based on the lessons learnt from the first edition, this year the scope of the workshop is a bit broader (although still focusing on a very specific domain) and accepted submissions will include abstracts and position papers in addition to full papers. The workshop's main focus will be discussion rather than presentations, which are seen as seeds for boosting discussion topics, and an expected result will be a joint manifesto and a research roadmap that will provide the Semantic Web community with inspiring research challenges.",WorkshopEvent,Polymia,workshops1009,05/29/16,09:30:00,17:30:00,WS: SALAD,"full day: The World Wide Web has significantly evolved during the past 25 years, developing from a collection of a few interlinked static pages to a global ubiquitous platform for sharing, searching, and browsing dynamic and customisable content, in a variety of different media formats. Future developments bring the promise of a higher level of automation, distributed search and the use of intelligent personal agents1, which autonomously perform tasks on behalf of the user. The foundation for these trends is laid by the ever growing number of users and web sites, the increasing data volumes, but also by the use and popularity of Linked Data and Web APIs. Unfortunately, despite some initial efforts and progress towards integrated use, these two technologies remain mostly disjunct in terms of developing solutions and applications. To this purpose, SALAD aims to explore the possibilities of facilitating a better fusion of Web APIs and Linked Data, thus enabling the harvesting and provisioning of data through applications and services on the Web.",WorkshopEvent,Erato,workshops1010,05/29/16,09:30:00,17:30:00,WS: SEMPER,full day,WorkshopEvent,Kalia,workshops1011,05/29/16,09:30:00,17:30:00,WS: WhiSE,full day,WorkshopEvent,Melpo,workshops1012,05/29/16,09:30:00,12:30:00,Tutorial: DOREMUS,"half day: Music is everywhere. Files of recorded music are spread all over the web. Yet, despite the fact that this knowledge is described in sometimes great details in information systems of many cultural and media institutions around the world, nothing is harder than to find the history of a musical piece, its composer, its cultural origins, its lyricists and influences, its covers and interpretations, etc.
DOREMUS is a research project that aims to develop tools and methods to describe, publish, interconnect and contextualize music catalogues on the web using semantic web technologies. Its primary objective is to provide common knowledge models and shared multilingual controlled vocabularies. The data modeling Working Group relies on the cataloguing expertise of three major cultural institutions: Radio France, BnF (French national Library), and Philharmonie de Paris.

FRBRoo is used as a starting point, for its flexibility and its separation of concerns between a (musical) Work and Event (interpretation). We have extended the model with classes and properties specific to musical data, and we have published a set of shared multilingual vocabularies. The result shall enable fine-grained descriptions of both traditional and classical music works as well as the numerous concerts that are being regularly held.

The aim of this tutorial is to provide in-depth explanations of those models and controlled vocabularies and to show different applications consuming this data, such as exploratory search and music recommendation applications.",TutorialEvent,Thalia,tutorials1013,05/29/16,09:30:00,12:30:00,Tutorial: Data Quality and Scalability,"half day: This tutorial offers a walk through several techniques in the field of Semantic Data Management. These techniques stem across coping with semantic data provenance and ontology learning, dealing with dynamics and evolution; improving quality of semantic data and linked data in decentralized settings, at scale, allowing trust and autonomy, guaranteeing consistency; improving quality by applying multi_type and large_scale entity resolution, also at scale; and finally enabling feasible assertion of new knowledge by applying large scale parallel reasoning.

Such ontologies and data sets, although often useful, also lead to problems when used in semantically-enabled applications. Wrong conclusions may be derived or valid conclusions may be missed. Further, during the recent years, more and more mappings both between ontologies as well as entities in the Linked Open Data cloud have been generated, e.g., using ontology alignment and/or entity linking systems, forming a linked network of data sets and ontologies. This has led to a new opportunity to deal with defects, as links between datasets and ontologies may be exploited for debugging, or the interlinks between them. On the other hand, it also has introduced a new difficulty as the mappings may not always be correct and need to be debugged themselves. Also the linked data level may contain wrong information and omissions in the data as well as the links.
This workshop intends to be a forum where issues related to completing and debugging the Semantic Web are discussed.",WorkshopEvent,Ourania,workshops1016,05/30/16,14:00:00,17:30:00,WS: LDQ,"half day: The focus of this workshop is to reveal novel methodologies and frameworks in assessing, monitoring, maintaining, and improving the quality of Linked Data as well as to highlight tools and user interfaces which can effectively assist in its assessment and repair. In addition, the workshop seeks methodologies that help to identify the current impediments in building real-world Linked Data applications leveraging data and ontology quality. The benefits of addressing Linked Data quality issues will not only help in detecting inherent data quality problems currently plaguing Linked Data, but also provide the means to fix these problems and maintain the quality in the long run.",WorkshopEvent,Ourania,workshops1017,05/30/16,09:30:00,12:30:00,WS: MEPDaW,"half day: This workshop targets one of the emerging and fundamental problems in the Semantic Web, specifically the preservation of evolving linked datasets.

Apart from researchers and practitioners, the target audience comprises data publishers and consumers. Publishers will benefit from attending this workshop by learning about ways and best practises to publish their evolving datasets. Consumers benefit by being able to discuss their expectations, requirements and current systems to handle and process changing dataset in efficient ways.

To meet this challenge, we invite research contributions on all aspects of ranking, summarization, visualization, and exploration of entities, knowledge graphs, ontologies, and open data with particular focus on their summarization and presentation. We also welcome submissions on novel applications of these techniques.

A key goal of the workshop, focusing on research issues related to pre-modern scientific texts, is to emphasize the benefit of a multidisciplinary research to create and operate on relevantly structured data. The workshop organizers all belong to the Zoomathia international research network funded by the French National Scientific Research Center (CNRS). This network gathers French, Italian, German and English researchers and aims to study the formation and transmission of ancient zoological knowledge over a long period, with an historical, literary and epistemological approach, and create open knowledge sources on classical zoology to be published on the web of linked data.

Although the benefits of RDF for data representation and integration are indisputable, it has not been embraced by everyday programmers and software architects who care about safely creating and accessing well-structured data. Semantic web projects still lack some common tools and methodologies that are available in more conventional settings to describe and validate data. In particular, relational databases and XML have popular technologies for defining data schemas and validating data. These currently have no analog in RDF.
Shape Expressions (ShEx) has been designed as an intuitive and human-friendly high level language for RDF validation.

In 2014, the W3c chartered a working group called RDF Data Shapes to produce a language for defining structural constraints on RDF graphs. The proposed technology has been called SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language) and a first public working draft has been published in October, 2015.

In this tutorial we will present both ShEx and SHACL using examples and RDF data modelling exercises.

Like the popular SPARQL by example tutorial, this tutorial includes step-by-step instructions with examples followed by exercises. Participants can download validation tools to use locally or use web-based interfaces like RDFShape or W3C ShEx Workbench.",TutorialEvent,Melpo,tutorials1022,05/30/16,14:00:00,17:30:00,WS: LiME,"half day: If the future Web will be able to fully use the scale and quality of online media, a Web scale layer of structured and semantic media annotation is needed, which we call Linked Media. Drawing on the success of the Linked Data movement, we believe annotation of media using Linked Data concepts can be the basis for Web-wide media interlinking based on concept matching and relationships.
This 4th workshop on Linked Media (LiME-2016), building on previous successful events held at WWW2013, ESWC2014 and WWW2015, aims at promoting the principles of Linked Media on the Web by gathering semantic multimedia and Linked Data researchers to exchange current research and development work on creating conceptual descriptions of media items, multimedia metadata publication on the Web, and its semantic processing, particular based on Linked Data approaches to concept matching and relationships. Specifically, we aim to build a research community to promote a future Web where automated multimedia analysis results can be used as a basis to integrate Linked Data-based conceptual annotations into structured media descriptions, which can be published and shared online. When media descriptions are more easily findable and processable, new applications and services can be created in which online media is more easily shared, retrieved and re-used.",WorkshopEvent,Melpo,workshops1023,05/30/16,09:30:00,12:30:00,Tutorial: User Model Enrichment,"half day: User Modeling (UM) is a cross-disciplinary research topic that can be studied from different perspectives and disciplines, including human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, psychology and design.
This tutorial will focus on the role of user data, knowledge bases and reasoning techniques User Modeling. UM methods aim to create digital representations of users, and then adapt the interface or the content based on these models.

The tutorial will first provide an overview of the research in the area, presenting the evolution of User Modeling methods over the years, focusing on the role of data and methods from the social and semantic Web in the creation and enrichment of user models. Examples from most relevant state-of-art work will be presented.

Then, we will describe methods and techniques to be used in the User Modeling process to obtain user data, to enrich user data with person-related information as well as data from the Linked Open Data cloud, and to reason about these models. We will give a brief overview on methods for representing user models, how the models are used for providing recommendations and for evaluating these models.

Physicians could learn about the experiences of their colleagues, get hints to critical events in the treatment of a specific patient or receive information for improving treatment.

This workshop is devoted to the technologies for dealing with clinical documents for medical information gathering and application in knowledge based systems. The aim of the workshop is to encourage researchers from the medical natural language processing (NLP) and knowledge management community to present novel issues and techniques related to the extraction and processing of rich semantics from medical texts, but more importantly to discuss current challenges and future steps towards new directions for gathering and processing rich semantics in the medical domain.",WorkshopEvent,Thalia,workshops1025,05/30/16,14:00:00,17:30:00,Tutorial: LOD-lab,"half day: This tutorial will focus on obtaining hands-on experience with LOD Lab: a new evaluation paradigm that makes algorithmic evaluation against hundreds of thousands of datasets the new norm.

Our interest in RDF is well-timed for two reasons:
- there is a proliferation of RDF systems, and identifying the strong and weak points of these systems is important to support users in deciding the system to use for their needs;
- surprisingly, there is a similar proliferation of RDF bechmarks, a development that adds to the confusion since it is not clear which benchmark(s) should one use (or trust) to evaluate existing, or new, systems.
Benchmarks can be used to inform users of the strengths and weaknesses of competing software products, but more importantly, they encourage the advancement of technology by providing both academia and industry with clear targets for performance and functionality. Given the multitude of usage scenarios of RDF systems, one can ask the following questions:
- how can one come up with the right benchmark that accurately captures all these use cases?
- How can a benchmark capture the fact that RDF data are used to represent the whole spectrum of data, from structured (with relational data converted to RDF), semi-structured (with XML data converted to RDF) and completely natively unstructured graph data?
- How can a benchmark capture the different data and query patterns and provide a consistent picture for system behavior across different application settings?
- When one benchmark does not suffice and multiple ones are needed, how can one pick the right set of benchmarks to try?
These are particularly hard questions whose answers require both an in-depth understanding of the domains where RDF is used, and an in-depth understanding of which benchmarks are appropriate for what domains. In this tutorial, we provide some guidance in this respect by discussing the state-of-the-art RDF, and if time permits, graph benchmarks.",TutorialEvent,Clio,tutorials1,05/31/16,09:00:00,09:30:00,Opening Ceremony,ESWC2016 opening,AcademicEvent,Hermes | Apollon,plenary2,05/31/16,10:30:00,11:00:00,Coffee Break,Coffee Break,BreakEvent,,plenary3,05/31/16,12:30:00,14:00:00,Lunch,Lunch Break,MealEvent,,plenary4,05/31/16,15:30:00,16:00:00,Coffee Break,Coffee Break,BreakEvent,,plenary5,06/01/16,10:30:00,11:00:00,Coffee Break,Coffee Break,BreakEvent,,plenary6,06/01/16,12:30:00,14:00:00,Lunch,Lunch Break,MealEvent,,plenary7,06/01/16,15:30:00,16:00:00,Coffee Break,Coffee Break,BreakEvent,,plenary8,06/02/16,10:30:00,11:00:00,Coffee Break,Coffee Break,BreakEvent,,plenary9,06/02/16,12:30:00,14:00:00,Lunch,Lunch Break,MealEvent,,plenary10,06/02/16,15:30:00,16:00:00,Coffee Break,Coffee Break,BreakEvent,,plenary11,05/31/16,11:00:00,12:30:00,"Vocabularies, Schemas, Ontologies",Chair: Rinke Hoekstra,SessionEvent,Hermes | Apollon,research12,05/31/16,14:00:00,15:30:00,Machine Learning,Chair: Jens Lehmann,SessionEvent,Hermes | Apollon,research13,05/31/16,16:00:00,17:30:00,In-Use & Industrial,Chair: Mike Lauruhn,SessionEvent,Hermes | Apollon,inuse14,05/31/16,11:00:00,12:30:00,"Semantic Data Management, Big data, Scalability",Chair: Katja Hose,SessionEvent,Polymnia | Erato | Kalia | Melpo,research15,05/31/16,14:00:00,15:30:00,"Semantic Data Management, Big data, Scalability",Chair: Irini Fundulaki,SessionEvent,Polymnia | Erato | Kalia | Melpo,research16,05/31/16,16:00:00,17:30:00,Linked Data,Chair: Sébastien Ferré,SessionEvent,Polymnia | Erato | Kalia | Melpo,research17,05/31/16,11:00:00,12:30:00,ESWC Challenges 1,Chair: Stefan Dietze & Anna Tordai,SessionEvent,Clio,challenges18,05/31/16,14:00:00,15:30:00,ESWC Challenges 2,Chair: Stefan Dietze & Anna Tordai,SessionEvent,Clio,challenges19,05/31/16,16:00:00,17:30:00,ESWC Challenges 3,Chair: Stefan Dietze & Anna Tordai,SessionEvent,Clio,challenges20,05/31/16,17:30:00,18:30:00,MinuteMadness,Chair: Nadine Steinmetz & Giuseppe Rizzo,AcademicEvent,Hermes | Apollon,research21,05/31/16,19:00:00,20:30:00,Welcome Reception,Cocktails,MealEvent,Restaurant Fontana,22,06/01/16,09:15:00,09:30:00,Announcements,Announcements,AcademicEvent,Hermes | Apollon,plenary23,06/01/16,11:00:00,12:30:00,Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval,Chair: Pablo N.
