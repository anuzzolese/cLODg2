On the Web, ontologies are increasingly needed ? but OWL isn?t being used in many of these applications.? This talk explores some of the use and needs for ontologies on the Web in data integration, emerging technologies, and linked data applications.? It focuses on deficiencies in OWL's design that have hindered its application, and suggests some directions for making OWL more relevant to the modern Web, rather than the Web of the early 2000's. The talk ends with some challenges to the OWL, and greater ontology, community needed to be addressed if we are to see more use of ontologies on the Web.",Jim,Hendler,Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,mail_5,website_5,Hermes | Apollon2,05/01/16,09:30:00,10:30:00,Semanting Technologies in Business: are we there yet?,"Developing intelligent solutions requires a comprehensive understanding and management of the data. Intelligent semantic systems provide the smart technologies to harvest large amounts of data and insight in order to find solutions to the problems in various application areas. Typical challenges are: data acquisition from different types of sources; establishing links among different data types using both structure and content; dynamic, real-time processing of data; scalability for analytics and query processing, just to name a few. These challenges often prevent a business from even starting to look at the information and make sense out of it. At the same time, advances in cognitive computing offer new possibilities in analyzing unstructured information for richer insights. In this talk, we will use applications to discuss the use of semantic technologies, point out the research challenges, and highlight the business benefit from these technologies. We will conclude with a view on future research directions.",Eleni,Pratsini,"Smarter Cities Technology Center, IBM Research",mail_6,website_6,Hermes | Apollon3,05/02/16,09:30:00,10:30:00,Controlling Leakage and Disclosure Risk in Semantic Big Data pipelines,"In many Big Data environments, information is made available as huge data streams, collected and analyzed at different locations, asynchronously and under the responsibility of different authorities. It has become common for data analysts to have a mandate for computing Big Data  analytics without holding the rights to access the individual data points in the input, as they may contain sensitive information or personal data protected by privacy regulations.This talk discusses the idea that techniques used for semantic enrichment of Big Data (such as semantic lifting to harmonize metadata representation across data collection points and pre-joins at data ingestion time to avoid computing semantic joins on Big Data storage) can be seen as non-linear leakage and privacy risk boosters.  Intuition suggests that semantic techniques applied to  Big Data representation may have a double impact on security risks:(1) increase leakage risk by increasing the value for the attacker per unit of information leaked(2) increase intrusion risk, making injection attacks (i.e. attacks aimed at poisoning data for subverting the outcome of analytics) more effective per unit of poisoned information injected .   However, no clear methodology is currently available for quantifying the impact of these boosters. This talk will discuss a (semi-)quantitative technique for computing Big Data leakage risk estimates, in order to meaningfully compare them with the quantifiable benefits of semantic enrichment. Also, it will discuss  a model  and a toolkit for protecting semantically enriched data streams based on the idea of dynamic filters, incrementally built based on the applicable Access Control policy and on the analytics to be performed.",Ernesto,Damiani,Universit‡ degli Studi di Milano,mail_7,website_7,Hermes | Apollon
